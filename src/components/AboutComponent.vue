    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
    Hi! I’m class PythonAddict, a programmer passionate about Desktop App Dev, and Web Apps!
    
    <br><br>
    
    I dabble in a lot of languages, including Python, C#, Go, Javascript, Typescript, and C++ but I mainly use these 4 languages -
    
    <br><br>
    
    <strong>Python</strong> - Python was the first language I actively learned, and my favourite by far. I use for just about everything - developing gui’s with PyQt5 and Tkinter, writing web apps with Flask and Quart, writing interpreters and transpilers, programming challenges, simple games, etc.
    
    <br><br>
    
    <strong>Golang</strong> - Golang is known for simplicity, and this is one of the reasons I love it. I mainly use it for writing API’s, but also to program algorithms when I require speed!
    
    <br><br>
    
    <strong>C#</strong> - C# was the second language I learnt, and ever since then, I’ve grown addicted to it nearly as much as I like Python. I use C# mainly for desktop apps with Windows Forms, but I’ve also used it in a couple of other projects, including interpreters and transpilers!
    
    <br><br>
   
    <strong>Vue.js</strong> - I learn Vue.js to help me write large web applications, uptill then I’d only used plain ol’ Javascript and Html. Its the framework I use regardless of my project requirements or size, as I find very intuitive and easy to use!
